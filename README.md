# Keylogger
This is a user tracking application that collects keystrokes, web history, and chat history, as well as the ability to restrict a website from being opened on the system defined by the administrator.
Data security and recovery will be essential factors in many firms, therefore data recovery will be required in many circumstances. Users can retrieve data using the Spy key logger application if a working file is damaged due to a power outage, for example. To get data, this application uses log files. We can use this application to retrieve a forgotten email or URL.
In this keylogger project, everytime the user enters something on the keyboard, the keystrokes are recorded and emailed to the admin's email address without the user's awareness within the time limit


# Introduction
In many IT infrastructure organizations now-a-days, data security and data recovery are the most important factors which is basically deployed in Computer Forensics. Computer forensics consists of the art of examining digital media to preserve, recover and analyze the data in an effective manner. There are many cases where data recovery is required essentially. So by using keylogger application users can retrieve data in the time of disaster and damaging of working file due to loss of power etc.
Keyloggers are specially effective in monitoring ongoing crimes. This is a surveillance application used to track the users which log keystrokes, uses log files to retrieve information, capture a record of all typed keys. The collected information is saved on the system as a hidden file or emailed to the Admin or the forensic analyst.
Keyloggers have the advantage of collecting information before it is encrypted; thus making a forensic analyst’s job easier. Most keyloggers show no signs of any intrusion within the system allowing for them to gain typed information without anyone having knowledge of its actions except the user who use it. Keyloggers incorporate a wide array of cyber security issues and provide a practical approach to understand topics such as attacker goals, varieties of malware and their implementation, the role of malware in infecting and how stealth is archived in an infected system.
